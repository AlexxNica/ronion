# Ronion
Generic anonymous routing protocol framework agnostic to encryption algorithm and transport layer.

This repository contains both the spec and reference implementation.

WARNING: INSECURE UNTIL PROVEN THE OPPOSITE!!!

This protocol and implementation are intended to be secure, but until proper independent audit is conducted you shouldn't consider it to actually be secure and shouldn't use in production applications.

WARNING: WIP, not ready for any use, API is incomplete, unstable, etc.
