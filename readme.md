# Ronion
Generic anonymous routing protocol framework agnostic to encryption algorithm and transport layer.

This repository contains high level design overview (design.md), specification for implementors (spec.md) and reference implementation.

WARNING: INSECURE UNTIL PROVEN THE OPPOSITE!!!

This protocol and reference implementation are intended to be secure, but until proper independent audit is conducted you shouldn't consider it to actually be secure and shouldn't use in production applications.

## Current status
Specification and design are not finalized yet, but seem good already.

Implementation API should be near stable and unlikely to change unless major spec changes are needed.

Still considered unstable, so be careful and make sure to report any issues you encounter. Project is covered with tests though to ensure it works as intended (see `tests` directory).

## Implementation API
TODO: See tests for now

## License
Implementation: MIT, see license.txt

Specification and design: public domain
